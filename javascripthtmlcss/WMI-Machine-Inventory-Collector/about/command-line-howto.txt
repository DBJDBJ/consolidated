1. Running 

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js

(without parameters) collects info about local computer and opens the resulting xml file in a browser.

2. Running

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

collects info about computer who's IP address is 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' and opens the resulting xml file in a browser.

3. Given the 'silent' key, script runs in a 'silent mode':

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js /silent xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

collects info about computer who's IP address is 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' and doesn't show the resulting xml file;

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js /silent

collects info about local computer and doesn't show the resulting xml file.

4. You can specify as much IP adresses as you wish:

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js /silent xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy zzz.zzz.zzz.zzz

Note: for all of the above methods, target computer's OS must contain a user account
      with username/password that match user's credentials that local system provides.

5. Given the 'username' and 'password' keys, script uses given credentials instead of
   those provided by the system:

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js /username:alice /password:anywordyoulike xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

6. Given the 'domain' key, you can query a computer in a different domain; NTLM authentication is used.

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js /domain:acme /username:alice /password:anywordyoulike xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

7. Given the 'auth' key, you can control the way you authenticate on the target domain.
   If this key is equal to "kerberos", Kerberos authentication is used; otherwise, NTLM
   authentication is used.

   [cscript] wmiadmin.js /domain:acme /username:alice /password:anywordyoulike /auth:kerberos xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

8. Provided 'wmi_administrator.htm' page is a prototype of an WMI administration tool.
   You can specify target computer's IP address, username, password and domain name
   in the appropriate fields; hit "Start WMI query" to retrieve the WMI info.

Note: before running the GUI tool, please check your browser security settings to be sure
      that it allows creation and execution of ActiveX components.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: - WMI installed on every computer you query;
              - WSH installed on computer on which the script is run;
              - 'wmiadmin.xsl' stylesheet must reside in the directory
                            where the 'wmiadmin.js' script is located.
