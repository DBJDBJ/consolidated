**Imagine spiral staircase. That is it.** 

Github allows for Fluid but Controlled project development. 

1. engage in project [issues](https://github.com/DBJDBJ/glosos/issues)
   1. After few weeks, try and learn [issues search](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)
      1. in your own time. It is really simpler than it looks
      2. Example: search by label ![](media/search_by_label.png)
